	<h3>Extract from Derry Journal - June 26th 2020</h3>
    <p>A graphic account of the shooting of James McVeigh was told by a William Canning who accompanied him up Long Tower Street on his fateful journey. As they approached the top of the street, they saw men kneeling with rifles in their hands at Fountain St. Shots were being fired and one, deliberately aimed, caught McVeigh in the throat. Canning looked around and saw McVeigh stagger in the direction of Mullan’s public house where he fell. It was almost a quarter of an hour before they could approach the dying man who was lying in a pool of blood moaning. Eventually, they were able to drag him through Bishop’s Gate and into a house in Stable Lane from where he was carried on a shutter to the infirmary. He was dead when he reached there. Mr. McVeigh had three sons in the British Army.
